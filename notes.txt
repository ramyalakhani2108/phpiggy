Middleware
- A function that can run before or after a controller has been executed.
- in a nutshell, they are a feature for running functions before and after a controller handles a request
- at that moment, code inside a controller only get executed for specific request  
 
what is a contract?
- A contract is just another name for an interface
- because they for a class to have a specific implementation similar to how you must fulfil an agreement
- in this project we create interface contract for every middleware so all middleware have common methods 



what is singleton pattern?
- A design pattern for restricting  a class to a single instance 
- we must provide a way to sharing instances between different class.
