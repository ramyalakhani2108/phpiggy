what is template engine?
package for generating dynamic html 
it has features to help us loop through data, conditionally render templates , and import data into a template

Why do we use template engine 
->easy for frontend developer
->Can isolate data 
->most populars are ==>twig by symphony
                    ==>blade by laravel

in this course we have created a template engine for our framework



Middleware
- A function that can run before or after a controller has been executed.
- in a nutshell, they are a feature for running functions before and after a controller handles a request
- at that moment, code inside a controller only get executed for specific request  
 
what is a contract?
- A contract is just another name for an interface
- because they for a class to have a specific implementation similar to how you must fulfil an agreement
- in this project we create interface contract for every middleware so all middleware have common methods 



what is singleton pattern?
- A design pattern for restricting  a class to a single instance 
- we must provide a way to sharing instances between different class.


What is http status code ?

it is three digit intigier to inform the browser the status of the request
1xx - information codes (request is still being request so connection doesnt end)
2xx - success
3xx - redirect user to different page
4xx - client error 
5xx - Server related error

Session 

At the moment we want to show errors after redirection of same page ,
it becomes unavailable after redirection ,  session can resolve the issue

php variables are stored temporarily after a page gets displayed in the browser
from php server

after a page get displayed the connection between the server and browser is closed 
once the conneciton is get closed, php starts destroying data created during the connection.
this allows for resources from the server to be free

as a result, those result can be allocated for other requests from other users 


for storing data session used 

sessions are a feature for storing data longer than a single request. They are destroyed. They are distroyed after a user closes a browser
